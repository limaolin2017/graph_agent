# Evaluation Roadmap

## Current State
Basic custom evaluator measures percentage of requested steps completed by checking successfully called tools against required steps.

## Short-term Goals
1. **LangSmith Tracing** - Add tracing for agent execution
2. **Quality Metrics** - Assess generated test code quality
3. **Performance Evaluator** - Measure execution time and resource usage

## Medium-term Goals
1. **Tool-specific Evaluators** - Create evaluators for all core tools
2. **Intent Alignment** - Check agent actions align with user intent
3. **Error Handling** - Evaluate error handling and recovery capabilities

## Long-term Goals
1. **Comparative Evaluation** - A/B testing framework for agent versions
2. **Multi-turn Evaluator** - Assess context maintenance across interactions
3. **Regression Detection** - Automated alerts for performance drops

## Implementation Priorities
1. LangSmith Integration
2. Quality Metrics
3. Performance Monitoring
4. Tool-specific Evaluators
5. User Experience Metrics

## Success Metrics
- 95%+ step completion accuracy
- 90%+ test code quality score
- Sub-10s average response time
- 99%+ uptime
- Positive user feedback

## Resource Requirements
- LangSmith account
- OpenAI API credits
- Manual evaluation set creation time
- Evaluation pipeline infrastructure
