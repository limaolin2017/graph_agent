# Evaluation Roadmap

## Current State ✅
**Implemented Evaluators:**
1. **Workflow Completion Evaluator** - Measures if full web testing pipeline (scraping → requirements → tests) was completed
2. **Content Consistency Evaluator** - Assesses whether generated artifacts accurately reflect actual webpage content
3. **Basic Performance Metrics** - Tracks step completion, tool calls, success rates

## Recently Completed ✅
1. **LangSmith Integration** - Full tracing for agent execution
2. **Anti-Hallucination Detection** - Identifies invented features not present in scraped content
3. **Quality Assessment Pipeline** - Multi-dimensional evaluation framework

## Short-term Goals
1. **Requirements Accuracy Evaluator** ⏳ - Detailed analysis of requirement quality vs actual page content
2. **Test Code Executability Checker** ⏳ - Validates generated test scenarios can actually run
3. **Performance Benchmarking** ⏳ - Response time and resource usage optimization

## Medium-term Goals
1. **Completeness Scoring System** - Measures coverage of important page elements
2. **Multi-turn Context Evaluator** - Assesses context maintenance across interactions
3. **Comparative A/B Testing** - Framework for evaluating different agent versions

## Long-term Goals
1. **Comparative Evaluation** - A/B testing framework for agent versions
2. **Multi-turn Evaluator** - Assess context maintenance across interactions
3. **Regression Detection** - Automated alerts for performance drops

## Implementation Priorities
1. LangSmith Integration
2. Quality Metrics
3. Performance Monitoring
4. Tool-specific Evaluators
5. User Experience Metrics

## Evaluator Specifications

### 1. Workflow Completion Evaluator
**Purpose:** Validates complete web testing pipeline execution
**Criteria:**
- ✅ Web scraping step completed successfully
- ✅ Functional requirements generated
- ✅ Test code produced in requested format
**Scoring:** 0-100 based on completion percentage and step quality

### 2. Content Consistency Evaluator  
**Purpose:** Prevents hallucination and ensures accuracy
**Criteria:**
- Requirements only describe features actually present on page
- Test scenarios target real UI elements and interactions
- No invented features or generic assumptions
**Scoring:** 0-100 based on factual accuracy vs scraped content

### 3. Requirements Accuracy Evaluator (Planned)
**Purpose:** Deep analysis of requirement quality
**Criteria:**
- Completeness: All important page elements captured
- Specificity: Requirements are detailed and actionable
- Relevance: Focus on testable functionality
**Scoring:** Multi-dimensional assessment with weighted components

### 4. Test Code Executability Checker (Planned)
**Purpose:** Validates practical utility of generated tests
**Criteria:**
- Syntax correctness for target framework (Gherkin/Cypress)
- Realistic user interaction flows
- Proper element selectors and assertions
**Scoring:** Binary pass/fail with detailed feedback

## Success Metrics
- 95%+ workflow completion rate
- 90%+ content consistency score
- 85%+ requirements accuracy rating
- Sub-10s average response time
- 99%+ test code executability

## Resource Requirements
- LangSmith account
- OpenAI API credits
- Manual evaluation set creation time
- Evaluation pipeline infrastructure
